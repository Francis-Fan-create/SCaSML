# LQG

We solve the following [PDE](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1718942115)

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\lambda\|\nabla_x u(x,t)\|^2+\Delta_x u(x,t)=0,\\&t\in[s,T],x\in DâŠ‚\mathbb{R}^d
$$

whose terminal condition is given by

$$
u(x,T)=g(x):=\ln (\frac{1+\|x\|^2}{2}),
$$

without any boundary constraints.



This PDE has an explicit solution at time $t$

$$
u(x,t)=-\frac1\lambda\ln\left(\mathbb{E}\left[\exp\left(-\lambda g(x+\sqrt{2}W_{T-t})\right)\right]\right).
$$

which is our target in this section.



Specifically, we consider the problem for

$$
d=100, \sigma=0.25, D=[-0.5,0.5]^{100}, s=0, T=0.5
$$
