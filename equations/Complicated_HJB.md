We solve the following [PDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02016)(labeled as Eq(100) in the original paper)

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-(\frac1d\sum_{i=1}^d|\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i}|^c+2)+\Delta_x u(x,t)=0,t\in[s,T],x\in DâŠ‚\mathbb{R}^d
$$

whose terminal condition is given by


$$
u(x,T)=g(x):=\sum_{i=1}^d x_i,
$$

without any boundary constraints.



This PDE has an explicit solution at time $t$

$$
u(x,t)=\sum_{i=1}^d x_i+(T-t).
$$

which is our target in this section.



Specifically, we consider the problem for

$$
d=100, \sigma=0.25, D=[-0.5,0.5]^{100}, s=0, T=0.5
$$

In the experiment, we set $c=1$.
